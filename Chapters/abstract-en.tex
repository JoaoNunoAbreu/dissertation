\noindent Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a biological macromolecule whose primary function is to store information. DNA sequence data is currently growing at an exponential rate due to advances in sequencing technology, which has moved the study of DNA sequences into the big data era. Furthermore, machine learning is a strong tool for processing massive amounts of data and learns on its own and it has been widely employed in the analysis of DNA sequence data. Viral identification and classification are crucial to prevent an epidemic like \emph{COVID-19}.

However, building a machine learning classifier of biological sequences is a tough challenge due to the non-numerical properties of the sequence elements that the model requires. This means that the most difficult component of the problem is feature selection. High dimensionality is aggravated by the most widely used representations, because sequences lack explicit features. Deep learning models have recently been developed that can extract features from input automatically.

The main goal of this research is to create a tool that can automatically extract features from DNA sequences and classify them using deep learning models and algorithms. Transcription factor annotation and essential gene determination will be used as case studies for the platform validation.
