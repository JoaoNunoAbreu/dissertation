\noindent Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a biological macromolecule whose primary function is to store an individual's genetic information. Because of breakthroughs in sequencing technology, the number of DNA sequences is now growing at an exponential rate. The assignment of a function to these sequences is a great obstacle in Bioinformatics, and current methods rely on homologies, a solution that is slow and less accurate. Machine learning (ML) has been widely employed as it is a relevant tool for processing huge amounts of data by learning on its own without explicit programming. Using ML, it is now possible to speed up and automatically classify DNA sequences into existing categories with the objective of learning their functions. 

However, building a machine learning classifier of biological sequences is a tough challenge due to the lack of numerical properties in the sequence that the model requires. Therefore, it is still necessary to apply some pre-processing techniques so that the sequences are properly represented for the model. These techniques include feature extraction and feature selection, and they are the most difficult components because sequences lack explicit features. Deep learning models have recently been developed that not only extract features from input automatically, but also improve the prediction and classification of DNA sequences.

The main goal of this project is to create a tool that can automatically classify DNA sequences using machine and deep learning models and algorithms, followed by its integration into \textit{ProPythia}, a Python package developed by the host group. Automated ML classifiers will also be developed to integrate in \textit{OmniumAI} software platforms. Transcription factor annotation and essential gene determination will be used as case studies for the platform validation. With this study, it is intended to encourage the use of such technologies to develop new tools that can manage vast volumes of biological data, thus boosting DNA prediction understanding.
