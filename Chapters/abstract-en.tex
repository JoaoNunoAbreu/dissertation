\noindent Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a biological macromolecule whose primary function is to store information. DNA sequence data is currently growing at an exponential rate due to advances in sequencing technology, which has moved the study of DNA sequences into the big data era. To extract useful knowledge from these massive amounts of data, machine learning has been widely employed as it is a strong tool for processing huge amounts of data by learning on its own without explicit programming. Using machine learning, it is possible to speed up and automatically classify DNA sequences into existing categories, and then be able to learn their functions. Viral identification and classification are crucial in order to prevent an epidemic like \emph{COVID-19}.

However, building a machine learning classifier of biological sequences is a tough challenge due to the non-numerical properties of the sequence elements that the model requires. This means that the most difficult component of the problem is feature selection. High dimensionality is aggravated by the most widely used representations, because sequences lack explicit features. Deep learning models have recently been developed that can extract features from input automatically.

The main goal of this project is to create a tool that can automatically classify DNA sequences using deep learning models and algorithms. Transcription factor annotation and essential gene determination will be used as case studies for the platform validation.
