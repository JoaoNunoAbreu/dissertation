\noindent Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a biological macromolecule whose primary function is to store information. DNA sequences hold an individual's genetic information and contain almost all the information about an individual's health and physical well-being. The knowledge of these sequences are currently growing at an exponential rate due to advances in sequencing technology, which has moved the study of DNA sequences into the big data era. To extract useful knowledge from these massive amounts of data, machine learning has been widely employed as it is a strong tool for processing huge amounts of data by learning on its own without explicit programming. Using machine learning, it is now possible to speed up and automatically classify DNA sequences into existing categories with the objective of learning their functions. For example, viral identification and classification are crucial in order to prevent an epidemic like \emph{COVID-19}.

However, building a machine learning classifier of biological sequences is a tough challenge due to the lack of numerical properties in the sequence that the model requires. Therefore, it is still necessary to apply some pre-processing techniques so that the sequences are properly represented for the model. These techniques include feature extraction and feature selection, and they are the most difficult components. High dimensionality is aggravated by the most widely used representations, because sequences lack explicit features. Deep learning models have recently been developed that can extract features from input automatically.

The main goal of this project is to create a tool that can automatically classify DNA sequences using deep learning models and algorithms. Transcription factor annotation and essential gene determination will be used as case studies for the platform validation.
