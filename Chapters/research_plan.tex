As previously mentioned in Section~\ref{subsec:what_are_dna_sequences}, by looking at the sequence of a DNA segment, scientists can figure out what kind of genetic information it contains. 

For example, scientists can utilize sequence information to determine which stretches of DNA include genes and which stretches have regulatory instructions that turn genes on or off. This is achieved by finding a protein called \gls{TF} which are \gls{DBS} that bind target DNA to activate or suppress gene transcription and are involved in a variety of biological activities. The research of \gls{TF} function begins with accurate identification of \gls{TF}s~\cite{Hu2019AnimalTFDBFactors}.
